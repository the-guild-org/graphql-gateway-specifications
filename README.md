# GraphQL Gateway Specifications 

As part of the development process of [Conductor](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/gateway) (by [The Guild](https://the-guild.dev/)), we are open-sourcing and building a collection of community specifications for implementing GraphQL features and extensions.

This repository aims to discuss, suggest, and build a community-backed set of specifications.
